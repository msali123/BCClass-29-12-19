# Terms of Service
### Modified: July8th, 2020
Certifly offers a cloud-based software platform for commercial drones (“Services”), making the power of aerial data accessible and productive for everyone. Since our products are cloud based, you can access them through the web and through a number of device types (e.g., desktop, laptop, tablets, and smartphone and other mobile devices).

This agreement, the Certifly Terms of Service (“Terms”), outlines the terms regarding your use of our products and services. These Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Certifly, LLC (“Certifly”, “we” or “us”) so please read carefully. If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not register or use any of the Services.

### 1. Using our Services
You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Do not misuse our Services. For example, do not interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access other than as expressly set out in these Terms. Other than User Content (addressed below), you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

### 1.1 - Fair Usage
Our Fair Use Policy has been created to prevent improper use of Certifly software, so we can offer all our customers an excellent user experience. The Fair Use Policy for our SaaS solution include user access, data processing, storage, sharing and API traffic. Each Certifly license is to be used by one person only.This includes a reasonable amount of data creation for a single person and is not to be shared with any other user. We determine the scope of Fair Use; we consider your license usage against the typical usage across the universe of accounts. When we detect out of the ordinary levels of usage in your Certifly account, we will contact you to discuss the situation and potential alternatives. If the situation persists, we reserve the right to limit your account or terminate your license and access to the system.

### 1.2 - Eligibility
By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us:

(a) - your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;

(b) - you have not previously violated any FAA or other aviation regulation; and

(c) - you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service

### 1.3 - User Responsibility
You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable legal requirements for the operation of any aircraft, including any requirements related to detecting and avoiding other aircrafts. You must at all times comply with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations related to the operation of unmanned aerial devices and your use of the Service in your territory of operation, including any applicable laws with regard to privacy. You will obtain and maintain all licenses, consents, and any applicable authorizations.

### 2 - Your Certifly Account
You may need a Certifly Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Certifly Account, or your Certifly Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer. An account is defined as one named user individual (“User”) that can use the Service at a time. Multiple Users may not use the same User account via sharing login details or utilizing a team-based email address. Only one human being can be associated with a particular User account. If you are using a Certifly Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply, and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.

To protect your Certifly Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Certifly Account. You should not use your Certifly Account password on third-party applications.

The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, images and all other elements of the Service (“Materials”) provided by Certifly are protected by intellectual property and other laws.

In addition, we will own any and all right, title, and interest in, and to any feedback, suggestions, information, or materials you convey to us related to the Service in connection with your use of the Service. You hereby assign to Certifly all right, title, and interest in such information.

### 4 - Billing and Payment

For monthly payment subscription plans, the Service is billed automatically in advance via credit card monthly and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. No exceptions will be made.

You shall pay Fees in accordance with the Order Form.

If you have elected to pay Fees via credit card and the credit card is charged back to Certifly or if any Fees invoiced to you are not paid within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, Certifly may: (i) with respect to chargebacks, cease charging your credit card and invoice you for the amount charged back and any future Fees; (ii) accelerate the payment of any Fees payable; (iii) immediately suspend your access to the Services until payment is made; and/or (iv) immediately terminate the applicable Order Form for which Fees were due and/or terminate this Agreement.
